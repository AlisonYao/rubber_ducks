see id of inputs in input_id.txt  inside frontend

Alison notes:
the file public is what firebase really looks for
The index.html file is the main webapp for the single-page application
I will keep everything in frontend and backend files separately and try to put things together in the public file

rn, I can do login with google in public/index.html
please install firebase and run "firebase deploy" to actually see it work
the login does not work on a local server
