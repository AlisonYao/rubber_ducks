Since we are using Google Firebase to bring our webapp online and Firebase looks for the **public** directory, the **public** directory contains all essential frontend components for Firebase deployment. All backend codes are stored in **backend** directory.


Inside the **public** directory, **index.html** is the first webpage where our website link https://together-we-study.web.app/ goes directly to our login page and from there you can explore all the functions on our website on your own! From there you can login and be redirected to our **homepage.html** to update your settings. From homepage, you can enter the studyroom of your choose and be redirected to **room1.html** where you can study with your fellow students and finish your study plan.


The **backend** directory holds all our backend codes in python, where **main.py** has all the main backend functions.
