Since we are using Google Firebase to bring our webapp online, the **public** directory contains all essential components for Firebase deployment.


Inside the **public** directory, **index.html** is the first webpage where our website link https://together-we-study.web.app/ goes directly to our login page and from there you can explore all the functions on our website on your own!


As **index.html** is the first webpage, the rest of our frontend codes are stored in the **frontend** directory with multiple other webpages and complementary CSS, JS and png files.


The **backend** directory holds all our backend codes in python, where **database/main.py** has all the main backend functions.


The **studyroom** directory is our main application and where the magic happens. As the core of our frontend, **studyroom** directory consists of all the functions that enable our users to find a seat in the virtual studyroom and reach their daily study plan with the company of their fellow students from all over the world.
